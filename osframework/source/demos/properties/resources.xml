<!-- 
	All resources.xml files must contain the ResourceManifest section.
	
	Just like when we loaded resources manually in demos 1-3, you do
	not have to specify the extensions for images and sounds.

	Use the ResourceGen.exe program to convert this XML into C++ code.
	The variable names that you give to the resources below will then be
	accessible by any file that includes your resource header file 
	(generated by ResourceGen.exe).
	
	Resource groups can be loaded/deleted at any time. Thus, it's advantageous
	to split your resources into groups if you don't need to have every single
	resource in memory at the same time. A common use for grouping is to
	split the title screen, main menu, and main game elements up. Then,
	when the main game is playing, you can kick out the main menu and title
	screen data. Similarly, when you are back to the main menu, you can kick out
	the game resources. How you use the grouping is up to you, it's provided
	for your convenience.	
	
	Remember in previous demos how we had to manually set an image's
	mNumRows and mNumCols by hand? Not anymore. If we had an image we
	wanted to load that contained more than 1 row or column, we could
	specify the optional parameters: cols and rows. As an example, here's
	how we'd load in that lightning image from a previous demo:
	
	<Image id="LIGHTNINGT" path="images/lightning" rows="8"/>
	
	And then it's automatically set for you when you load the resource.
